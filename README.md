TSP---Ant-Colony-Optimization
=============================

Implementaion of Travelling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization

Generally used techniques to solve the TSP is the Greedy Approach(Branch and Bound). The Branch and Bound approach works well only if the no. of cities are around 12 - 15, but in real life scenario, the no. of cities may go upto 100 or more. The ACO implementation works quite well for around 100 cities.
